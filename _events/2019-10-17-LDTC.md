## Legislative Data and Transparency Conference

### Description
The 2019 Legislative Data and Transparency Conference (#LDTC2019) brings individuals from Legislative branch agencies together with data users and transparency advocates to foster a conversation about the use of legislative data – addressing how non-profits, individuals, and public and private agencies use technology well and how they can use it better in the future. The conference is presented by the Committee on House Administration with support from the Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Bulk Data Task Force.
