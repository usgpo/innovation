## Congressional Hackathon 7.0  

### Description
Since its inception in 2011, the Hackathon has always been co-hosted by the Speaker and Minority Leader. In 2023, the House Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) joined as a co-host for the first time. This joint effort delivers on a House Select Committee on Modernization recommendation to institutionalize the Hackathon. 

The Hackathon brings together House Members, congressional staff, legislative branch agency staff, open government and transparency advocates, civic hackers, and developers from digital companies to explore the role of digital platforms in the legislative process. Discussions range from data transparency to constituent services, public correspondence, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, committee hearings, and the broader legislative process.  

House Leaders also provide updates on the digital and data efforts within the legislative branch. Participants then break into different groups to actively brainstorm and explore new ideas on how to leverage technology to streamline and improve operations in the legislative branch.     
  
Staff with the Congressional Data Task Force will be in attendance.
